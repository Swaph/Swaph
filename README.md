Hey there, I'm Swaph! 👋 I'm a self-taught front-end developer with a flair for UI/UX design and technical content writing. 💻 When it comes to coding, my skills are focused on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I'm always eager to learn more and tackle new challenges. 🚀

When I'm not busy coding, I binge-watch TMNT, space documentaries and animated sci-fi sitcoms. I'm also a big reader and love diving into cynical poetry (shoutout to Charles Bukowski 🙌) and thrilling fiction by Stephen King.

If you're interested in connecting and chatting about all things web development (or Donatello, of course!), I'm always down for a good convo! 🤝.
