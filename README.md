"Stay scientific Jerry!"
Hey! I'm Swafiyah, a Python-loving software engineer exploring the world of AI and Machine Learning. I'm all about building smart, useful tech that makes a difference, especially here in Africa. Whether it's backend dev, data wrangling, or experimenting with ML models, I'm always up for a challenge. Let's build something cool!
